== What is Cloud Foundry?

Cloud Foundry is an open platform-as-a-service (PaaS). The system supports
multiple frameworks, multiple application infrastructure services and
deployment to multiple clouds.

== What is this component?

This repo contains the sample BOSH package and release for a sample Cloud Foundry service:
echo service (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap-services/tree/master/echo)
the section below will walk you through how to deploy echo service into Cloud Foundry

== How to deploy echo service with BOSH package and release?

1. git clone cf-release repo (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release)
2. git clone vcap-services-sample-release repo (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap-services-sample-release)
3. cp -r vcap-services-sample-release/jobs/* cf-release/jobs/
   cp -r vcap-services-sample-release/packages/* cf-release/packages/
4. append the content of vcap-services-sample-release/config/blobs_echo.yml to cf-release/config/blobs.yml
5. add 'echo' into 'builtin_services' section of cloud controller configuration file - see https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/blob/master/jobs/cloud_controller/templates/cloud_controller.yml.erb#L161 . An simpler alternative way to achieve this is for CC to get the token from external_service_tokens - see https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/blob/master/jobs/cloud_controller/templates/cloud_controller.yml.erb#L174-L179. Add 'external_service_tokens' under 'properties' section like this:

      external_service_tokens:
        oauth2: foooauth2token

6. bosh create release and then bosh upload release
7. in your BOSH deployment manifest, add below section under 'jobs', for example insert into https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/samples/cloudfoundry.yml#L294

    - name: echo_node
      template: echo_node
      instances: 1
      resource_pool: infrastructure
      persistent_disk: 128
      networks:
      - name: default
        static_ips:
        - 192.0.2.90

    - name: echo_gateway
      template: echo_gateway
      instances: 1
      resource_pool: infrastructure
      networks:
      - name: default

   and add gateway token under 'properties', for example insert into https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/samples/cloudfoundry.yml#L632

    echo_gateway:
      token: changeechotoken
      service_timeout: 15
      node_timeout: 10
    echoserver:
      port: 5002

   and change resource pool size if necessary, see https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/samples/cloudfoundry.yml#L55

8. bosh deploy

== Deploy echo service under ccng

Deploying echo service under ccng is the same as that under legacy CC.
The difference is that to make echo service available, some additional
steps are necessary. To achieve that, you should use the high version
vmc and the vmc admin plugin:

    gem install vmc --pre
    gem install admin-vmc-plugin

login as the cc administator:

    vmc login $ADMIN_USER --password $ADMIN_PASSWORD
    vmc create-service-auth-token --provider core --token changeechotoken --label echo

$ADMIN_USER and $ADMIN_PASSWORD could be found in your bosh deployment
manifest under section 'uaa.scim.users'. It may take several minutes
before it takes effect. Issue `vmc info --services` to make sure that
echo service is available.
